        <h1 class="comic-title">Shakti: The Rising Darkness</h1>
        <p class="comic-intro">The peace that Shakti brought to Mumbai after defeating the ancient spirit was short-lived. Darkness, once thought vanquished, begins to creep back into the city, more powerful and sinister than before. As night falls, the shadows lengthen, and a cold dread grips the heart of Mumbai. Shakti senses the rising evil but is unaware of the full extent of the threat that lurks in the dark corners of the city.</p>

            <p>The disappearance of people begins as whispers in the night—rumors of those who venture out after dark never returning. Shakti investigates these mysterious vanishments, tracing them to the darkest alleys and forgotten parts of the city. He encounters ghostly, shadow-like figures that slip away as quickly as they appear. The deeper he delves into the shadows, the more he realizes that this is no ordinary threat. The shadows seem alive, feeding on fear and growing stronger with each disappearance.</p>

            <p>Shakti’s investigation leads him to the discovery of a hidden cult—the Dark Alliance. This secretive group has been manipulating the shadows, using dark rituals to summon beings from beyond the veil of reality. The cultists worship the ancient spirit Shakti once defeated, but their ultimate goal is far more sinister. They seek to awaken a being of unimaginable power, a force that will plunge the world into eternal darkness. Shakti realizes that the fight is no longer just about saving the city; it’s about preventing the end of the world.</p>

Under the influence of the Dark Alliance’s dark magic, this former friend steals Shakti’s amulet, the source of his power. Shakti is left powerless, at the mercy of the cult and their dark forces. The shock of the betrayal and the loss of his powers leave Shakti vulnerable, forcing him to rely on his inner strength to survive.</p>

            <p>As the battle reaches its peak, Shakti uncovers the true nature of the entity the Dark Alliance is trying to summon. It is a force of pure chaos, a being capable of unmaking reality itself. Shakti realizes that this is the entity that has been pulling the strings all along, the real mastermind behind the darkness. With every ounce of his strength, Shakti channels the power of the elements, launching a final, all-out assault against the dark force. The struggle is fierce, but Shakti manages to drive the entity back into the void. However, he knows this victory is temporary. The darkness has not been defeated, only delayed. The final battle is still yet to come.</p>
